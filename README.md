# Data-Science-Lab
Awesome repository for all my Data Science Experiments

# About
This respository consists of jupyter notebooks which follows a step by step process which is usually followed in a data science experiment.

The goal is to adding new use-cases which solved a particular problem using Machine Learning using the data which is readily available on Kaggle or any other open source site.

# Experiment 1 - Credit Payment Default
## Use Machine Learning to predict whether a customer will default in his/her next payment
