# Data-Science-Lab
Awesome repository for all my Data Science Experiments

# About
This respository consists of jupyter notebooks which follows a step by step process which is usually followed in a data science experiment.

The goal is to adding new use-cases which solved a particular problem using Machine Learning and I will be using the data which is readily available on Kaggle or any other open source site.

# Experiment 1 - Credit Payment Default
## Use Machine Learning to predict whether a customer will default in his/her next payment
Check out the code here - <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iamrajatroy/Data-Science-Lab/blob/main/notebook/Credit_Payment_Default_Notebook.ipynb">Notebook</a>


# Experiment 2 - Tensorflow Sequential API and Subclassing
## A walkthrough code for comparing different approaches of model training with Tensorflow
