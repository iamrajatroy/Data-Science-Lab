Awesome repository for all my Data Science Experiments

This respository consists of jupyter notebooks which follows a step by step process which is usually followed in a data science experiment.

The goal is to adding new use-cases which solved a particular problem using Machine Learning using the data which is readily available on Kaggle or any other open source site.
